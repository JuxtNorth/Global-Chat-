# MERN Project

This is a MERN project that uses MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js to create a basic chat application with authentication. Furthermore, Socket.io is used to establish real-time connections between authenticated users.

## Prerequisites

- You need to have Node.js, Git and MongoDB installed on your machine.
- You need to have pnpm installed globally. You can install it with `npm install -g pnpm`.

## Installation

- Clone this repo to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/north077/global-chat-.git`.
- Move into the project directory using `cd global-chat-`.

## Running the dev server

- Start MongoDB by running `mongod` in a terminal window.
- Move into the client directory using `cd client` and run `pnpm dev` to start the React development server.
- Move into the server directory using `cd server` and run `pnpm dev` to start the Express development server.
- The client will be running on http://localhost:5173 and the server will be running on http://localhost:3000.
- You can now test the application in your browser.
